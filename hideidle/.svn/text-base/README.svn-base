Here are 2 InspIRCD modules that help hiding the idle time of IRC users.
Idle time can be used to cheat: it's is given by a simple /whois,
and allows anyone to see if someone has just said something,
and guess he is the the secret night channel.

m_hideidlechan.cpp adds the 'U' channel mode, which hides the idle time of the
  users in that channel.

m_hideidle.cpp allows users to set the 'U' user mode, which hides their
  idle time.

* Put one of them in the src/modules/ directory of InspIRCD
* Add a <module name="m_hideidle"> (or m_hideidlechan) tag in the config file
* Run ./configure -modupdate and make install
* Rehash the ircd or use the /LOADMODULE command to add them
