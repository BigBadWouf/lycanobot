* Make a real time-based action scheduling (removing the set_timeout message
  hack). Would be usefull for players deconnection recovery timout, and many
  other things.
* Automatic special cards choice, based on numbers of players and choosed theme.
* commands : !whoami, !lastword
* add a stats system using XML
* say who is waking up or going to sleep (optionnal)
* Improve the %votes so we could set things in each vote such as :
  - hidden votes (!vote in private then announce the votes)
  - !unvote allowed or denied
  - vote changes allowed or denied
* another history than Thiercelieux's one, maybe Mafia
* Commands aliases (such as vs for votestatus, or v for vote)
* Proper handling of selected players in votes (targets who /quit remains
  targetted)
* Make a logging system (maybe used by the stats one)
