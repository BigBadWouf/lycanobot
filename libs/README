This directory keeps some libraries. Currently, Lycanobot uses a modified
version of the Net::IRC library, which is here in Net/.
This version is the 0.75 one with the patches located in patches/.

* Net-IRC-0.75-lycanobot.patch :

  It adds support for the events triggered upon receipt of unknown IRC numerics
  (not in Event.pm). Such events can have a handler, using the usual
  add_handler('XXX', ...) function, where XXX is the numeric.

  Also, the Net::IRC documentation says that the 'other' event is triggered
  when an unknown event happens, but this doesn't work. This version fixes that.

* Net-IRC-0.75-token_bucket_pacing.patch :

  It adds support for a token-bucket based rate limitation system (in sending),
  replacing the existing lines-based system. Just like it, it is activated
  giving the existing "Pacing" arg to the newconn() method of a
  Net::IRC::Connection object. If pacing is set, it uses the "MaxSend" and
  "MaxTime" args that prevents more than MaxSend bytes to be sent within
  MaxTime seconds.
  In Lycanobot, the corresponding config args are in the <rate> tag.

Lycanobot can run using the regular Net::IRC library, but you'll probably see
some annoying warnings about uninitialized values, and admin and users
identification may not br able to use the registered nicks (seen in a /whois).

You can patch your own library if you want (but it's not needed by Lycanobot
as long as it keeps this Net::IRC lib), using the patch in the patches/
directory. You may do something like:

 $ cd /where/perl/libs/are
 $ patch -p0 < /somewhere/lycanobot/patches/Net-IRC-0.75-lycanobot.patch

On my current system (Arch), perl custom libs are located in
/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/current/.
